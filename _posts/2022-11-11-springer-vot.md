# Abstract
> The Visual Object Tracking challenge VOT2022 is the tenth annual tracker benchmarking activity organized by the VOT initiative. Results of 93 entries are presented; many are state-of-the-art trackers published at major computer vision conferences or in journals in recent years. The VOT2022 challenge was composed of seven sub-challenges focusing on different tracking domains: (i) VOT-STs2022 challenge focused on short-term tracking in RGB by segmentation, (ii) VOT-STb2022 challenge focused on short-term tracking in RGB by bounding boxes, (iii) VOT-RTs2022 challenge focused on real-time short-term tracking in RGB by segmentation, (iv) VOT-RTb2022 challenge focused on real-time short-term tracking in RGB by bounding boxes, (v) VOT-LT2022 focused on long-term tracking, namely coping with target disappearance and reappearance, (vi) VOT-RGBD2022 challenge focused on short-term tracking in RGB and depth imagery, and (vii) VOT-D2022 challenge focused on short-term tracking in depth-only imagery. New datasets were introduced in VOT-LT2022 and VOT-RGBD2022, VOT-ST2022 dataset was refreshed, and a training dataset was introduced for VOT-LT2022. The source code for most of the trackers, the datasets, the evaluation kit and the results are publicly available at the [challenge webpage](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2022).
