# Problem Statement
Localising objects under [fragmented occlusion](https://doi.org/10.1006/cviu.1996.0006) is an important pre-requisite for [through-foliage detection](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-69460-9_16) in forests. Unfortunately, [state-of-the-art detectors fail](https://www.doi.org/10.3217/978-3-85125-752-6-23) to accurately localise objects under this type of occlusion.

Interestingly, [human vision](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F20416695211062625) seems to overcome fragmented occlusion seemlessly by integrating partial, visual percepts over time. 

# Goal
The thesis builds on previous work based on an encoder-decoder network and aims at open questions to be answered such as:
* how to improve the method to generalise to empty scenes and to scenes with more than one person,
* why does the network generalise to occluded sequences from unoccluded training data,
* how to adapt the encoder to allow visualisation of the features

# Requirements
* Basic knowledge in computer vision or computer graphics
* Basic experience in C++, Python, Julia
* Interest in machine learning, maths, statistics

# Workflow
## TUM
Detailed information can be found [here](https://www.in.tum.de/in/fuer-studierende/master-studiengaenge/informatik/abschlussarbeit/).

## TU Wien
You should be enrolled in the Master Programmes Visual Computing or Data Science. The thesis can be combined with an Informatik Praktika. Please, do not forget to attend the mandatory [courses](https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/diplomarbeiten/allgemeine-hinweise-zu-masterarbeiten) (as well for theÂ [Praktika](https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/informatik-praktika/allgemeine-hinweise-zu-bachelorarbeiten-und-praktikas)). You will write a thesis proposal at the beginning where you are welcome to formulate your own research ideas in agreement with the supervisor.
