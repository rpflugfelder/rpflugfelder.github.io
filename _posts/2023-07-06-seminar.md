Computer Vision has been considering various models of neural networks, originally invented in the
Machine Learning community, in the last years. These models have been very successfully applied to
visual tasks such as motion analysis, object tracking, SLAM, object segmentation, object classification,
object detection and scene understanding.

The aim of this seminar is to give the student the opportunity to choose and then study a particular model
and its applications in computer vision. By the end of the seminar, all attendees will understand the
principles and the applications of these selected models, and they will receive the ability to reuse these
models as common design patterns in their own models and applications.
