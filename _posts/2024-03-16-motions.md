categories: thesis

We seek a PhD student to research motion computation and object detection under occlusions, smoke, fog, low image contrast, and tiny as well as fast-moving objects.

This research is important because such phenomena happen frequently in natural environments. Forests and open land are becoming more and more important for vision applications. In contrast to cities and the artificial environment, motion computation and recognition are challenged by the natural environment.

Furthermore, occlusion is a longstanding in vision and still not satisfyingly solvable with [neural models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09215). How visual learning can help to overcome it is still being determined, but there are [good arguments](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8gb8x6w9) that more than visual learning is needed to solve the problem.

The research will use a new methodology by combining traditional, bottom-up methods from first principles with neural networks and ML. You will establish potential training and benchmark data and define appropriate performance metrics for different sensor modalities, such as visual and thermal.

You are part of a team working at the cutting edge of technologies for AI systems by addressing practical problems from various stakeholders of European research projects. You will gain experience from renowned international scientists and build your network to build up your scientific profile in cooperation with the European research community. Your work could be under the scientific examination of Prof. Daniel Cremer at the Technical University of Munich.
