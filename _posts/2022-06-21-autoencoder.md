title: "Deoccluding Autoencoder"
categories: thesis

# Problem Statement
Occlusion is a substantial problem in object recognition. A special type of occlusion is [fragmented occlusion](https://doi.org/10.1006/cviu.1996.0006) where only small and always different parts of the object are visible at a time.

Interestingly, [human vision](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F20416695211062625) is able to spatiotemporally analyse such fragmental, visual percepts and allows accurate object recognition even for very challenging scenes such as to recognise a moving object of interest behind a fence.

# Goal
The thesis aims at the idea to learn a neural function of deocclusion by an encoder-decoder archiecture in spirit similar to a denoising autoencoder. The candidate is asked to investigate avenues of unsupervised learning by using examples with synthetic occlusion.

# Workflow
The thesis can be combined with an Informatik Praktika. Please, do not forget to attend the mandatory <a href="https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/diplomarbeiten/allgemeine-hinweise-zu-masterarbeiten/">courses</a> (as well for theÂ <a href="https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/informatik-praktika/allgemeine-hinweise-zu-bachelorarbeiten-und-praktikas/">Praktika</a>). You will write a thesis proposal at the beginning where you are welcome to formulate your own research ideas in agreement with the supervisor.
