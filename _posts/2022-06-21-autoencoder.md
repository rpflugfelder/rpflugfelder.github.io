# Problem Statement
Occlusion is a substantial problem in object recognition. A special type of occlusion is fragmented occlusion where only small and always different parts of the object are visible at a time.

Interestingly, human vision is able to spatiotemporally analyse such fragmental, visual percepts and allows accurate object recognition even for very challenging scenes such as to recognise a moving object of inerest behind a fence.

# Workflow
The thesis can be combined with an Informatik Praktika. Please, do not forget to attend the mandatory <a href="https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/diplomarbeiten/allgemeine-hinweise-zu-masterarbeiten/">courses</a> (as well for theÂ <a href="https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/informatik-praktika/allgemeine-hinweise-zu-bachelorarbeiten-und-praktikas/">Praktika</a>). You will write a thesis proposal at the beginning where you are welcome to formulate your own research ideas in agreement with the supervisor.
