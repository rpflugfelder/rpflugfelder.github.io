# Abstract
> Object detection in natural environments is still a very challenging task, even though deep learning has
brought a tremendous improvement in performance over the last years. A fundamental problem of object detection
based on deep learning is that neither the training data nor the suggested models are intended for the challenge
of fragmented occlusion. Fragmented occlusion is much more challenging than ordinary partial occlusion and occurs
frequently in natural environments such as forests. A motivating example of fragmented occlusion is object detection
through foliage which is an essential requirement in green border surveillance. This paper presents an analysis of
state-of-the-art detectors with imagery of green borders and proposes to train Mask R-CNN on new training data which
captures explicitly the problem of fragmented occlusion. The results show clear improvements of Mask R-CNN with this
new training strategy (also against other detectors) for data showing slight fragmented occlusion.
