# Abstract
> Occlusion is a fundamental challenge in object recognition. Fragmented occlusion is much more
challenging than ordinary partial occlusion and occurs in natural environments such as forests. Less
is known in computer vision about fragmented occlusion and object recognition. Interestingly, human
vision has far more explored this problem as the human visual system evolved to fragmented occlusion
at the times when mankind occupied rainforest. A motivating example of fragmented occlusion is
object detection through foliage which is an essential requirement in green border surveillance.
Instead of detection, this paper studies the simpler problem of localisation with persons. A neural
network based method shows a precision larger than 90% on new image sequences capturing the problem.
This is possible by two observations: (i) fragmented occlusion is unsolvable in single images
without temporal information, and (ii) colour quantisation and colour swapping is essential to force
the training of the network to learn from the available temporal information in the spatiotemporal
data.
