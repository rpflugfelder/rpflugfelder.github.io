I am a Marie Curie fellow in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.in.tum.de/en/) at the University of Munich. I am member of the [Dynamic Vision and Learning Group](https://dvl.in.tum.de) at the [Chair of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence](https://cvai.in.tum.de).

I am also a fellow in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il) at the Technion, Israel, where I am a member of [Michael Lindenbaum's Group](https://mic.net.technion.ac.il).

I am Scientist at the [AIT Austrian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.at) where I am currently on leave.

I am lecturer in the [Faculty of Informatics](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at) at TU Wien where I am member of the [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at) at the Institute of Visual Computing & Human-Centered Technology.

and lecturer at TU Wien. He received in 2002 a MSc degree in Informatics at TU Wien and in 2008 a PhD in Telematics at the TU Graz, Austria. In 2001, he was academic visitor at the Queensland University of Technology, Australia. His research focuses on visual motion analysis, tracking, recognition, and visual learning applied to automated video surveillance. He aims to combine sciences and theories in novel ways to gain theoretical insights into learning and inference in complex dynamical systems and to develop practical algorithms and computing systems. Roman contributed with 60+ papers and patents to research fields such as camera calibration, object detection, object tracking, event recognition where he received awareness of media as well as several awards and grants for his scientific achievements. Roman is also senior project manager at AIT where he has led cooperations among universities, companies and governmental institutions. Roman co-organised the Visual Object Tracking Challenges VOT'13-14 and VOT'16-21 and was program chair of AVSS'15. Currently he is steering committee member of AVSS. He is regular reviewer for major computer vision conferences and journals.
