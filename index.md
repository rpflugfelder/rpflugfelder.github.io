I am a Computer Scientist and [EuroTech](https://eurotech-universities.eu) Marie Curie fellow of the Technical University Munich and the Technion in Haifa, Israel where I am working in [Daniel Cremer's](https://vision.in.tum.de/members/cremers) and [Michael Lindenbaum's](https://mic.net.technion.ac.il) group.
I am affiliated with the [AIT Austrian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.at) and the [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at) at TU Wien where I am currently on leave.

I enjoy to build with my research bridges to applications in the field of video surveillance. Technologies such as my [traffic monitor](https://sciencev1.orf.at/news/35843.html) based on competitive learning, our IEEE/CvF WACV'14 Best Paper [CMT](https://www.gnebehay.com/cmt/results.html) tracker based on the consensus of parts, or the indoor localisation with non-overlapping security cameras applying our [camera calibration](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-16199-0_12.pdf) based on SfM were successfully used by governmental organisations and companies. For this, I managed at AIT a team of six researchers and coordinated a strategic programme [Mobile Vision](https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20130910_OTS0063/ait-und-tu-graz-buendeln-staerken-in-der-internationalen-bildverarbeitungsforschung-bild) in cooperation with [Thomas Pock](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-pock/people/pock/), TU Graz and [Bernhard Rinner](https://bernhardrinner.com), University of Klagenfurt.

I graduated under supervision of [Horst Bischof](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/people/team-about/horst-bischof/) with a PhD in Telematics at TU Graz. Before, I received my Diploma in Informatics from TU Wien and with a [Kurt Goedel stipend](https://kgs.logic.at) from the Queensland University of Technology, Australia under supervision of Horst Bischof, [Brian Lovell](https://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/lovell/) and [Kurt Kubik](https://itee.uq.edu.au/profile/1961/kurt-kubik).

I was awarded for my scientific contributions in 2008 with a Viennese [WWTF](https://www.wwtf.at/index.php?lang=EN) Career Grant and in 2014 with the IEEE/CvF WACV Best Paper Award. I received several reviewer awards (2016 - J. of Image and Vision Computing, 2017 - J. of Pattern Recognition, 2019 - CVPR) for my community work. I was awarded 2022 a EU Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowship.

I initiated in 2012 together with [Matej Kristan](https://www.vicos.si/people/matej_kristan/) the [VOT challenges and workshop series](https://www.votchallenge.net).
