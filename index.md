I am a [EuroTech](https://eurotech-universities.eu) Marie Curie fellow of the Technical University Munich and the Technion in Haifa, Israel. I am a member of [Daniel Cremer's](https://vision.in.tum.de/members/pfl) and [Michael Lindenbaum's](https://mic.net.technion.ac.il) group.

Since 2007, I have worked in the position of a Scientist at the [AIT Austrian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.at) and as lecturer in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at) at TU Wien where I built 2008-2015 as manager of governmental and EU funded projects a team of six researchers. I coordinated 2012-2016 AIT's Austrian strategic programme [Mobile Vision](https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20130910_OTS0063/ait-und-tu-graz-buendeln-staerken-in-der-internationalen-bildverarbeitungsforschung-bild) in cooperation with [Thomas Pock](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-pock/people/pock/), TU Graz and [Bernhard Rinner](https://bernhardrinner.com), University of Klagenfurt.

A [Kurt Goedel stipend](https://kgs.logic.at) allowed me 2001-2002 to pursue a master's degree in Computer Science and Informatics under the supervision of [Brian Lovell](https://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/lovell/) and Horst Bischof at the Queensland University of Technology, Australia and the TU Wien. I graduated in 2008 under supervision of [Horst Bischof](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/people/team-about/horst-bischof/) with a PhD in Telematics at TU Graz.

Some of my contributions to science and the scientific community were awarded in 2008 with a Viennese [WWTF](https://www.wwtf.at/index.php?lang=EN) Career Grant, in 2014 with the IEEE/CvF WACV Best Paper Award and in 2019 with the CVPR Outstanding Reviewer award. In 2012, I found together with [Matej Kristan](https://www.vicos.si/people/matej_kristan/) the [VOT challenges and workshop series](https://www.votchallenge.net).

Technologies such as my [traffic monitor](https://sciencev1.orf.at/news/35843.html) in 2010 or the [CMT](https://www.gnebehay.com/cmt/) tracker or the indoor localisation of our [surveillance camera calibration](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-16199-0_12.pdf) were successfully used by governmental (research) organisations and (international) companies.

My hobbies are walking, hiking, swimming and riding my bike.

Please, see my [CV](assets/docs/sci-cv-pflugfelder.pdf) for more details.
