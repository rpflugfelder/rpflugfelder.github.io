I am a Computer Scientist and [EuroTech](https://eurotech-universities.eu) Marie Curie fellow of the Technical University Munich and the Technion in Haifa, Israel where I am working in [Daniel Cremer's](https://vision.in.tum.de/members/pfl) and [Michael Lindenbaum's](https://mic.net.technion.ac.il) group.
I am affiliated with the [AIT Austrian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.at) and the [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at) at TU Wien where I am currently on leave.

The focus of my current research is on the problem of dynamic, fragmented occlusion in machine and human vision. My broader scientific interest lies in motion analysis and tracking and in the importance of motion perception in object recognition and scene understanding.

I also enjoy to build with my research bridges to applications in the field of video surveillance. Technologies such as my [traffic monitor](https://sciencev1.orf.at/news/35843.html) based on competitive learning, our IEEE/CvF WACV'14 Best Paper [CMT](https://www.gnebehay.com/cmt/results.html) tracker based on the consensus of parts or the indoor localisation with non-overlapping security cameras using our [camera calibration](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-16199-0_12.pdf) based on SfM were successfully used by governmental organisations and companies.

I graduated under supervision of [Horst Bischof](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/people/team-about/horst-bischof/) with a PhD in Telematics at TU Graz. Before that I received my Diploma in Informatics from TU Wien and the Queensland University of Technology, Australia under supervision of Horst Bischof and [Brian Lovell](https://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/lovell/).

Please, see my [CV](assets/docs/sci-cv-pflugfelder.pdf) for more details.

A [Kurt Goedel stipend](https://kgs.logic.at) allowed me to pursue 2001-2002 a master's degree in Computer Science and Informatics under the supervision of [Brian Lovell](https://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/lovell/) and Horst Bischof at  and TU Wien. 

I was awarded for my scientific contributions in 2008 with a Viennese [WWTF](https://www.wwtf.at/index.php?lang=EN) Career Grant and in 2014 with the IEEE/CvF WACV Best Paper Award. I received several reviewer awards (2016 - J. of Image and Vision Computing, 2017 - J. of Pattern Recognition, 2019 - CVPR) for my community work. 

I founded in 2012 together with [Matej Kristan](https://www.vicos.si/people/matej_kristan/) the [VOT challenges and workshop series](https://www.votchallenge.net).

where I built 2008-2015 as a manager of governmental and EU funded projects a team of six researchers. I coordinated 2012-2016 AIT's strategic programme [Mobile Vision](https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20130910_OTS0063/ait-und-tu-graz-buendeln-staerken-in-der-internationalen-bildverarbeitungsforschung-bild) which was a cooperation among AIT, [Thomas Pock](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-pock/people/pock/), TU Graz and [Bernhard Rinner](https://bernhardrinner.com), University of Klagenfurt.
