A [Kurt Goedel stipend](https://kgs.logic.at) allowed me to pursue 2001-2002 a master's degree in Computer Science and Informatics under the supervision of [Brian Lovell](https://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/lovell/) and Horst Bischof at  and TU Wien. 

I was awarded for my scientific contributions in 2008 with a Viennese [WWTF](https://www.wwtf.at/index.php?lang=EN) Career Grant and in 2014 with the IEEE/CvF WACV Best Paper Award. I received several reviewer awards (2016 - J. of Image and Vision Computing, 2017 - J. of Pattern Recognition, 2019 - CVPR) for my community work. 

I founded in 2012 together with [Matej Kristan](https://www.vicos.si/people/matej_kristan/) the [VOT challenges and workshop series](https://www.votchallenge.net).

where I built 2008-2015 as a manager of governmental and EU funded projects
